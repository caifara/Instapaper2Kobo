# Instapaper2Kobo

Some scripts found and thrown together to easily download a
working instapaper epub with the kobo browser. 
The scripts were edited and Dropbox and a bookmark trick were added to be able to load the epub without using a cable.

# The problem

I want to read [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/)
articles with as few steps as possible on my Kobo Touch. For now there are two options
to my knowledge:

1. Use Calibre to automatically download your Instapaper feed. (Easy
   process,
   but you need to use a cable connection)
2. Use this (no cable, but with an extra step required)

(Hopefully the folks at Kobo solve this with their sync application
making this 'hack' obsolete)

# The idea

1. Have a shell script to download the Instapaper epub.
2. Convert the epub to make it readable on the Kobo Touch
3. Save it to Dropbox Public folder
4. Make a bookmark in the Kobo browser to that public Dropbox file

In order to get a new epub you have to:

1. Run the shell script on their computer
2. Load the bookmark on your Kobo

The cycle could off course be shortened one extra step (if Kobo doesn't
step up and resolve this properly) by doing the work on a
server on request. This may become an exercise for me later on. 

Furthermore it would be useful to archive articles once the epub has been downloaded.

# prerequisites

* bash
* calibre installed with the command line tools
* dropbox

# Installing the script

* clone from github
* create file ~/.instapaper2koborc with contents:


        INSTAPAPER_USERNAME=".@."
        INSTAPAPER_PASSWORD="..."
        DROPBOX_PATH="/absolute/path"


* you may want to alias the script in your .bashrc or .zshrc or maybe
  even alter your $PATH to be able to call instapaper2kobo directly

# Installing the custom bookmark

* After you have run the script for the first time go to dropbox and copy the
  link to the created file at Dropbox/Public/instapaper.epub
* Make a bookmark in the kobo browser (whatever)
* Connect the kobo to your computer
* Edit the bookmark in your favorite editor at
  /kobo-path/.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf (escape it like the saved
bookmark)

You can now download the instapaper ebook by only opening the browser
and clicking the bookmark.
